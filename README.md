# Rainbow Six Lag Fix

A Simple Solution to the lag problem of Rainbow Six.  

After playing like 2 or 3 games, I noticed that the game froze for 5~6 seconds and that happened often.  
Pretty annoying, I searched a reddit post that described the same thing and there was a solution:  
Open task manager, select rainbow six, set the affinity to the last core, and set it back to all core after that.  

I am lazy so I coded it into a tiny program. All you need is a click.
